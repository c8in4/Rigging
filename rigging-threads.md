# Rigging Threads & Cords

## Threads and Cords in general

**Bonded** - Bonded nylon has a protective coating on the thread to resist against fraying, needle friction and heat when it is sewn at higher speeds. Bonding also helps to prevent unraveling. It is important to note that colors of bonded threads appear slightly darker on the spool. Colors will become lighter when sewn.

**Left Twist** - The standard ply twist direction for almost every single-needle machine on the market. It is widely known as a Z-Twist, or Standard Twist.

**Size** - A number designation given to a threads thickness, based on weight. The most popular size is Size 69. There are 4 main size standards: Commercial, Tex, TKT, and Government.

Government sizes fall under Military Specification A-A-59826 (Formerly VT-295E)

### Nylon Thread Properties

### Normal Wear and Tear

**Elongation** - Nylon thread stretches about 26% over time. This is beneficial for its end use, because it allows for the seams to stretch with the fabric, allowing for 'breaking in'. For comparison - Kevlar Thread has about a 2% stretch.

**Mildew, Aging, and Sunlight** - Nylon thread has excellent resistance to mildew and aging, but prolonged exposure to sunlight causes some deterioration. Polyester or specially treated UVR Nylon are better for long-term exposure to sunlight. If seams are not exposed, nylon is usually okay.

**Abrasion** - Nylon Thread has excellent abrasion resistance.

**Heat** - Nylon thread will begin to yellow at around 300F(150ºC). Prolonged exposure to temperatures over 285F(140ºC) will cause deterioration. Nylon thread begins to stick at approximately 445F(230ºC), and melt at around 485(250ºC) to 500F(260ºC).

**Chemical Resistance** - Bleaches and Solvents - Nylon thread can be bleached in most solutions, but it is generally insoluble in most organic solvents. It is soluble in some phenolic compounds.

**Chemical Resistance** - Hydrocarbons - Nylon thread has excellent resistance to hydrocarbons such as gasoline, Diesel, and kerosene.

**Chemical Resistance** - Acids and Alkalis - Nylon thread is unaffected by most mineral acids, except hot mineral acids. It dissolves with partial decomposition in concentrated solutions of hydrochloric, sulfuric, and nitric acids. Soluble in formic acids. Substantially inert in alkalis.

#### Nylon Thread Limitations

**Outdoor applications with prolonged sunlight exposure** - Nylon thread can withstand moderate exposure to sunlight, provided that it is not exposed long term, or there is some sort of ultraviolet (UV) protection (e.g. windshields, or unexposed seams). This is why it is popular for automotive interiors, upholstery, and many other applications. It should not be used for outdoor furniture and sewing sails, awnings, tarpaulins. In these cases Polyester Thread or UVR Nylon thread are better choices. Polyester looks and feels like nylon, and has very close size-for-size strength. Its pricing is comparable to nylon.

**Fire retardant garments and gear** - Nylon thread yellows at 300F, sticks at 445F and melts at 500F. First responder garments and gear and some high temperature conveyer belts require much more fire resistance. Use Kevlar or Fire Retardant Sewing Thread in these situations. They are heat resistant to 600F or more and do not melt. However, they do not do well with UV. Their pricing is much higher than nylon.

**Critical strength requirements** - Nylon is strong but Kevlar Thread is about twice as strong. For example, size 92 nylon has a 15 pound tensile strength; the same size Kevlar has a 30 pound tensile strength. Kevlar's downside is that it costs about five times more than nylon and only available in yellow. Consider using heavier weight nylon or double-stitching to meet strength requirements.

**Chemical Resistance** - Nylon does well with some chemicals and not as well with others. Nylon thread can be bleached in most solutions, but it is generally insoluble in most organic solvents. It is soluble in some phenolic compounds.

### When nylon thread's size increases...

Commercial and Tex Equivalent numbers increase.  
Machine capability requirements increase.  
Thread diameter increases.  
Thread strength increases.  
Needle size increases.  
Needle heat and friction increase.  
Stitch visibility increases.  
Fabric ounce per yard increases.  
Leather ounce per yard increases.  
Yards per pound decreases.
